       <h1>Hello!</h1>
       <h2> Welcome To My html page created using python language</h2>
       <p>1.I created an HTML page by using Python. Now I will explain my code step by step.</p>
       <p>2.I use two modules 1.webbrowser to open the HTML page in a browser, 2. Path from pathlib to handle the file path safely without errors.</p>
       <p>3.I write the HTML content inside a variable called message. It includes a heading and a paragraph that will appear on the webpage.</p>
       <p>4.Then I write Python code by using file handlings concept to create a file called code.html and write the HTML content into it.</p>
       <p>5.I use a safe method (with open) to write the file so that it closes automatically after writing. This prevents any errors and ensures the file is saved properly.</p>
       <p>6.Finally, I use webbrowser to open the newly created HTML page in the default browser. I also convert the file path to a full address the browser can understand so it opens correctly.</p>
       <p>7.In this way, Python creates the webpage, puts content in it, saves it, and opens it for me automatically.</p>
